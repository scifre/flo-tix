# FloTix

A mobile application for scanning QR codes to validate e-tickets. Only registered users can scan QR codes, ensuring secure access control.

## Features

- 🔐 **Firebase Authentication** – Only registered users can scan QR codes.
- 📷 **QR Code Scanner** – Uses CameraX and ML Kit for fast and accurate scanning.
- 🎯 **Auto-Stop Scanning** – Prevents multiple scans of the same QR code.
- 📊 **Firestore Integration** – Fetches and displays data from Firestore.

## Working

- This project has two parts
  1. Sending QR tickets to the registered users using a Google Sheets AppScript.
  2. Verifying the tickets using an Android app.
- Here is a sample [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qLaVNJ6_vVdWjUwSAMqMsGMV0p3UmNtpzeVHwYW4x74/edit?usp=sharing), which shows the format in which data is collected for uploading to data store
- The AppScript at `appScript/FirestoreUpload.js` sends a QR ticket to the registered e-mail addresses in the sheet, and uploads the data fields(Name, College Name, Email, Phone, and Ticket Type) to Firestore.
- It also makes sure that a ticket is not sent multiple times.
- The QR code is the encoded payment ID of the transaction made by the user to buy the ticket.
- The encoded payment ID is also the document ID of the ticket in Firestore.
- Then when the ticket is scanned in the FloTix app, the QR code is decoded and the document ID is fetched from Firestore.
- The details from the ticket are shown in the app, and the verifier can mark the ticket as scanned, which is updated in Firestore, so if a ticket is scanned again, an alert is shown.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/scifre/flo-tix.git
   cd flo-tix
   ```

    - Create a collection named `attendees` in Firestore.
    - Download `google-services.json` and place it in `app/` directory.
3. **Set up Google Sheets**:
    - Create a google sheet in this [format](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qLaVNJ6_vVdWjUwSAMqMsGMV0p3UmNtpzeVHwYW4x74/edit?usp=sharing) or copy this one
    - Go to Extensions > AppScript.
    - Create a new AppScript project.
    - Copy the code from `appScript/FirestoreUpload.js` and paste it in the editor. save the file and open the Sheet.

## Usage
